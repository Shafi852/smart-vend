UPI enabled pen vending machine /n
(Abstract)
It has become a necessity in using pens in everyday life and making them accessible has come to the fore for a very long time.Be it at schools or colleges for jotting down notes or filling out forms and documenting reports at banks and offices, pens are of vital importance.These pens can be of any sort but non-plastic. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on unchecked use of plastic pens having adverse impact on the environment, it has been observed that 1600 to 2400 million pieces are brought to the market every year and 91% of plastic waste so generated was not recycled and the Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) was not being fully enforced.As an immediate solution to this, people have started producing eco-friendly pens made out of recycled papers and they come with a seed embedded in it.These seeds potentially can germinate and become a tree or a plant when discarded properly, and thereby aid at promoting afforestation while at the same time, reducing carbon footprints.But these are only produced  in small-scale and continue to face a tough competition with existing plastic pen manufacturers. 

To tackle the aforementioned problems , we have come up with a smart vending machine that dispenses recyclable paper pens to the end consumer.These machines can be placed at educational institutions,offices or wherever the pens are of high demand.By implementing them, small scale manufacturers gain upper hand over the large scale plastic pen manufacturers.  As their pens are being introduced to the market and placed at readily accessible areas, the gap between the consumer and manufacturer can be  decreased.

Conventional vending machines are easy to be messed with as the coins of same weight and dimensions can be easily forfeit. Notes tend to be rejected as it might not be clean if it is crumbled or fake.The proposed vending machines come equipped with the latest technologies such as dynamic UPI QRs  where the payments are done digitally and the stocks are monitored through web portals.
